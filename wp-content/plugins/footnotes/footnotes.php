 *
 * - Adding: Documentation: Readme.txt: informative 'Package Version' field in sync with the package version currently hidden in the main PHP script header.
 * - Adding: Documentation: Readme.txt: informative 'Version' field pointing a tag folder in SVN for bugfix versions available ahead of the stable tag.
 * - Adding: Documentation: Readme.txt: comment line below the 'Stable Tag' field to warn that this is (unexpectedly) parsed for release configuration.

 *
 * Package Version   Actual version string, informative only.
 *                   May identify a development version.
 *                   A 'd' series is suffixed to incremented bugfix version.
 *                   Used for style sheet cache busting.
 *
 * Version           Parsed in the main PHP file header for update configuration.
 *                   Refers to the latest tag.
 *                   Typically the best available version.
 *                   May not be released, due to release frequency concerns.
 *
 * Stable Tag        Parsed in the readme.txt in trunk/ for release configuration.
 *                   May be smaller than Version, avoiding too frequent releases.
 *
 * WordPress plugin readmes are usually lacking the version number of the package.
 * In Footnotes, this has been included after the stable tag had been mistaken for
 * the package version, given that state-of-the-art readmes have that information.

 *
 * The accidental release of 2.5.9d1 was due to 3 factors:
 *
 * 1. The codebase got overhauled for the sake of WordPress Coding Standards compliance,
 *    one requirement of which is that files be named after the name of the class in them;
 * 2. The renamed folder was not added to Subversion version control due to an unexpected
 *    unfamiliarity with the system and its command line interface;
 * 3. The Stable Tag field in the Readme header was used for the package version because
 *    the related field is lacking, and the use of file headers for release configuration
 *    is uncommon.
