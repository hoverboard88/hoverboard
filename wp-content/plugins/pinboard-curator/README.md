Pinboard Curator
================

This plugin was forked from windyjonas' [Delicious Curator Wordpress Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/delicious-curator/). I essentially did a search and replace for "Delicious" and changed the RSS feed link it pulls from. Thanks to windyjonas for doing pretty much all of the work on this plugin. Please donate to him below.

Create WordPress post based on Pinboard bookmarks

## Description

Google Reader removed the ability to share links within Google Reader, and instead started using google+ for this. That is all well, but it made the plugin Shareditems2WP obsolete.
But if you still want a way to create WordPress post based on one or more links that you shared from your RSS reader, you are in luck. Share the links to Pinboard ("bookmark" them), tag them with something recognizable and use this plugin to generate the post.

## The steps to take:

1. Install the plugin
2. Go to the settings page for the plugin and enter Pinboard user name and what Pinboard tag(s) to look for
3. Design the post template. Relax, it's short, easy and there's a default template you can use.
4. Share interesting stuff on Pinboard
5. Generate post (Press "Run now").
6. The post is generated as a draft, edit and publish the post.


## Installation

Search and install, this is the easiest part.
