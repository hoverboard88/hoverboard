Modifies Gravity Forms form fields and improves validation so that forms meet WCAG 2.0 accessibility requirements.

== Description ==

> This plugin is an add-on for the Gravity Forms plugin. If you don't yet own a license for Gravity Forms - <a href="https://rocketgenius.pxf.io/dbOK" target="_blank">buy one now</a>! (affiliate link)

**What does this plugin do?**

* Wraps radio, checkbox and list (repeater) fields in a fieldset.
* Improves form validation by displaying an on-page message that describes how many errors there were in the page. The message contains a list of the form fields with the errors, a description of the error and a link to the field.
* Adds aria-describedby attributes for date and website fields - providing clear instructions for screen reader users of what format is required for the field.
* Adds aria-describedby attributes for fields that have failed validation - providing clear instructions for screen reader users of what the field error is. Description used is the default validation message for the field, or if set, the validation message for the field.
* Disables the Gravity Forms configured tabindex - this stops users from being able to tab between fields and on-page links.
* Changes links in the form body, such as field descriptions or HTML fields, so they open in a new window. A title is added or appended to any existing title for screen reader users which reads 'this link will open in a new window'.
* Improved file upload field - wrapped in field set, clearly identifies to screen reader users if any file size of file type restrictions have been set of the field.
* Improved field instructions - if a description has been provided for the field, the field is 'described by' the description, using the aria-describedby attribute

**Please note:**

* Accessibility is a complicated topic and sometimes there are different opinions on how to best achieve an accessible website. Accessible forms are even harder to achieve, with many different approaches. If you have a suggestion, comment or request please leave a detailed message on the support tab.

* You will need to ensure that your websites theme is accessible.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**I still see errors on my form**

Whilst this plugin goes a long way to taking a Gravity Form towards WCAG 2.0 compliance, there are still some things that haven't been looked at yet.

If you're having troubles or even better know a solution, please leave a detailed message on the support tab.

I am aware of three issues that are yet to be resolved - duplicate ID's for checkbox lists, duplicate ID's for multi-page form wrappers (the hidden pages have the same ID), and duplicate ID's for the 'Save and continue later' link/button.

**Opening links in new windows - isn't that bad practice?**

Typically forcing links to open in a new window is bad practice, both from a usability and accessibility point of view. However when it comes to forms there is reason enough to do this - if the user clicks on the link they are taken away from the form - loosing any data they may have provided.

This plugin uses jQuery to modify the form once the browser has loaded it, any links in the form are changed to open in a new window (target='_blank'), then a title is added (or appended to the existing title) which reads 'this link will open in a new window'.

This is the	[H33: Supplementing link text with the title attribute](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H33.html) technique.

Why not use the [C7: Using CSS to hide a portion of the link text](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20140916/C7) technique?

I'm concerned it would have a negative consequence on SEO, because:

1. Search engines may down-rate your website, thinking you're attempting the black hat practice of stuffing a page with keywords that may not have any relevance to the content. 
2. Search engines may index the links with the hidden text. For example, 'document title this link will open in a new window' instead of 'document title'.

I'm willing to be convinced otherwise. But my goal is to make a Gravity Form accessible for everyone - which needs to take into account how it affects search engines.

**How is the plugin tested**

The plugin is tested using screen-reader software JAWS and the latest version of Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome.

The plugin is developed using the latest version of Gravity Forms. The plugin may work in previous versions but could have mixed results. Only the latest version of Gravity Forms can be supported.

The aim of the plugin is to make forms created using Gravity Forms have valid HTML and comply with WCAG 2.0 - level AA.

Each change the plugin makes to a Gravity Form has been decided through research into best practice for usability and accessibility.

**How do I disable the tabindex on the validation message**

I DO NOT recommend removing the tabindex.

After considered research I am of the belief that tabindex with a value of =-1 is perfectly fine, and infact quite helpful in making critical messages such as a validation message appear immidately for screen reader users.

With that said, if you want to disable it you can add this code to your theme's functions.php file, below the starting <?php line.

`add_action('itsg_gf_wcag_disable_tabindex', function () {
	return true;
});`

== Screenshots ==

1. Shows the improved validation message that is displayed when the form page contains errors. Validation message describes how many errors there were on the page and a list of the fields and errors. Each error is a link to the field. This message gets the browsers 'focus' when it is loaded - allowing screen reader users easy access to the information.
2. Shows list field with 'buttons' instead of images to add and delete rows - buttons are styled like the previous images but are keyboard accessible.

= 1.2.5 =

* ** REMOVED ** Feature: change 'Save and continue' link to a button. This provides better accessibility by providing 'Save and continue' as a form field - making it listed along side with the 'Previous', 'Next' and 'Submit' buttons when a screen reader user lists all form fields. e.g. JAWS + F5.

* Fix: changed validation alert so that HTML 'new line' <br/> is replaced with JavaScript 'new line' /n 
* Fix: added condition to column and field changing functions so that they only function on the front end - not in the Gravity Forms forms builder
* Maintenance: improved how date format instructions are built.
* Feature: 'list' field image buttons (add new row, delete row) are not keyboard accessible. Added to to replace with actual buttons they are keyboard accessible.
* Feature: add aria-describedby for website field - 'enter a valid website URL for example http://www.google.com'
* Fix: un-did 'required' attribute for checkbox field - it unduly made ALL checkboxes required, rather than just one.
* Maintenance: moved CSS to its own file.

= 1.1.0 =

* Feature: added aria-describedby for date fields - providing screen reader users with the instructions on how to type into the field, for example 'must be dd/mm/yyyy format'
