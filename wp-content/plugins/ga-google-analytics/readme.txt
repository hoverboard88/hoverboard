== Frequently Asked Questions ==


**How to enable Google Analytics 4?**

To enable __Google Analytics 4__: 

1. Follow [this guide](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9306384) to create a GA 4 account
2. During account creation, you'll get a tracking (measurement) ID
3. Add your new tracking ID to the plugin setting, "GA Tracking ID"
4. Select "Google Tag" for the plugin setting, "Tracking Method"

Save changes and done. Wait 24-48 hours before viewing collected data in your GA account.


**I am confused about all the different tracking methods?**

This article should help to get a better idea of the changes: [History of Google Analytics](https://onward.justia.com/history-of-google-analytics/)


**Tracking code is not displayed in source code?**

If you check the source code of your pages and don't see the GA tracking code, check the following:

* Check that your theme includes the hooks, `wp_head` and `wp_footer`
* If you are using a caching plugin, try clearing the cache

If the GA tracking code still is not displayed, most likely there is interference from another plugin or theme. In this case, the best way to resolve the issue is to do some basic [WordPress troubleshooting](https://perishablepress.com/how-to-troubleshoot-wordpress/).


**Google Analytic says tracking code is not detected?**

You need to wait awhile for Google to collect some data, like at least a day or whatever. Standard stuff for Google Analytics. For more information, check out the [Google Analytics Help Center](https://support.google.com/analytics/?hl=en#topic=3544906).


**Can I filter the output of the "Custom GA Code" setting?**

Yes, you can use the `gap_custom_code` filter hook.


**How to implement Google Optimize?**

Here are the steps:

1. Enable Universal Analytics in the plugin settings
2. Add the Optimize plugin (e.g., `ga('require', 'GTM-XXXXXX');`) to the setting, "Custom GA Code"
3. Add the Page Hiding (flicker) snippet to the setting, "Custom &lt;head&gt; Code"
4. Enable the setting, "Custom &lt;head&gt; Location"

Done! You can view the source code of your web pages to verify the results.

More info about [Google Optimize](https://support.google.com/optimize/answer/6262084).


**How to enable Opt-out of tracking?**

Here are the steps:

1. Add the following code to the plugin setting, "Custom Code": `<script>window['ga-disable-UA-XXXXX-Y'] = true;</script>`
2. Check the box to enable the setting, "Custom Code Location".

Done! You can view the source code of your web pages to verify the results.

More info about [user opt-out](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/user-opt-out).


**How to disable the "auto" parameter in ga(create)?**

By default the plugin includes the `auto` parameter in the tracking code:

	ga('create', 'GA-123456789000', 'auto');

However some tracking techniques (such as Site Speed Sample Rate) require replacing the `auto` parameter. To do it:

First disable the `auto` parameter by adding the following code to WordPress functions or [custom plugin](https://digwp.com/2022/02/custom-code-wordpress/):

	// GA Google Analytics - Disable auto parameter
	function ga_google_analytics_enable_auto($enable) { return false; }
	add_filter('ga_google_analytics_enable_auto', 'ga_google_analytics_enable_auto');

Now that `auto` is disabled, you can replace it with your own parameter(s). For example, to implement Universal Analytics Site Speed Sample Rate, enter the following code in the plugin setting "Custom Tracker Objects":

	{'siteSpeedSampleRate': 100}

Save changes and done. The resulting tracking code will now look like this:

	ga('create', 'GA-123456789000', {'siteSpeedSampleRate': 100});

So can adjust things as needed to add any parameters that are required.


**How to implement Anonymize?**

1. Add to "Custom Tracker Objects" setting: `{ 'anonymize_ip': true }`
2. Save changes and done.
