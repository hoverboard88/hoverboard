[More info on installing WP plugins &raquo;](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#installing-plugins)


### How to use the plugin ###

To enable Google Analytics tracking (GA4) on your site, follow these steps:

1. Follow [this guide](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9304153) to create a GA 4 account
2. During account creation, you'll get a tracking (measurement) ID
3. Add your new tracking ID to the plugin setting, "GA Tracking ID"

5. Configure any other plugin settings as desired (optional)

Save changes and done. After 24-48 hours, you can log into your Google Analytics account and view your site statistics.

__* Notes:__

The "Tracking ID" also may be referred to as "Measurement ID", "Property ID", or "Tag ID".

Also note that it can take 24-48 hours after adding the tracking code before any analytical data appears in your [Google Analytics account](https://developers.google.com/analytics/). To check that the GA tacking code is included properly, examine the source code of your web pages. Learn more at the [Google Analytics Help Center](https://support.google.com/analytics/).


### Upgrading Analytics ###

Google Analytics tracking methods [change over time](https://onward.justia.com/history-of-google-analytics/). First there was `urchin.js`, then `ga.js`, `analytics.js`, and then `gtag.js`. Now there is the latest and greatest, "GA4" (Google Analytics 4). If you are using an older version (anything other than GA4) and want to upgrade, check out this [upgrade guide](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10759417) from Google.


### Plugin Upgrades ###

To upgrade GA Google Analytics, remove the old version and replace with the new version. Or just click "Update" from the Plugins screen and let WordPress do it for you automatically.

__Note:__ uninstalling the plugin from the WP Plugins screen results in the removal of all settings from the WP database. 

For more information, visit the [GA Plugin Homepage](https://perishablepress.com/google-analytics-plugin/).


### Restore Default Options ###

To restore default plugin options, either uninstall/reinstall the plugin, or visit the plugin settings &gt; Restore Default Options.


### Uninstalling ###

GA Google Analytics cleans up after itself. All plugin settings will be removed from your database when the plugin is uninstalled via the Plugins screen. Your collected GA data will remain in your Google account.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==


**How to enable Google Analytics 4?**

Check out the top of this page, first section provides the steps to add GA4 to your site.


**I am confused about all the different tracking methods?**

This article should help to get a better idea of the changes: [History of Google Analytics](https://onward.justia.com/history-of-google-analytics/)


**Tracking code is not displayed in source code?**

If you check the source code of your pages and don't see the GA tracking code, check the following:

* Check that your theme includes the hooks, `wp_head` and `wp_footer`
* If you are using a caching plugin, try clearing the cache

If the GA tracking code still is not displayed, most likely there is interference from another plugin or theme. In this case, the best way to resolve the issue is to do some basic [WordPress troubleshooting](https://perishablepress.com/how-to-troubleshoot-wordpress/).


**Google Analytics says tracking code is not detected?**

You need to wait 24-48 hours (or longer) for Google to collect some data. Just takes time for Googlebot to crawl your pages, collect and process data, etc. For more information, check out the [Google Analytics Help Center](https://support.google.com/analytics/).


**Can I filter the output of the "Custom GA Code" setting?**

Yes, you can use the `gap_custom_code` filter hook.


**How to implement Google Optimize?**

Here are the steps:

1. Enable Universal Analytics in the plugin settings
2. Add the Optimize plugin (e.g., `ga('require', 'GTM-XXXXXX');`) to the setting, "Custom GA Code"
3. Add the Page Hiding (flicker) snippet to the setting, "Custom &lt;head&gt; Code"
4. Enable the setting, "Custom &lt;head&gt; Location"

Done! You can view the source code of your web pages to verify the results.

More info about [Google Optimize](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/12979939).


**How to enable Opt-out of tracking?**

Here are the steps:

1. Add the following code to the plugin setting, "Custom Code": `<script>window['ga-disable-UA-XXXXX-Y'] = true;</script>`
2. Check the box to enable the setting, "Custom Code Location".

Done! You can view the source code of your web pages to verify the results.


**How to disable the "auto" parameter in ga(create)?**

By default the plugin includes the `auto` parameter in the tracking code:

	ga('create', 'GA-123456789000', 'auto');

However some tracking techniques (such as Site Speed Sample Rate) require replacing the `auto` parameter. To do it:

First disable the `auto` parameter by adding the following code to WordPress functions or [custom plugin](https://digwp.com/2022/02/custom-code-wordpress/):

	// GA Google Analytics - Disable auto parameter
	function ga_google_analytics_enable_auto($enable) { return false; }
	add_filter('ga_google_analytics_enable_auto', 'ga_google_analytics_enable_auto');

Now that `auto` is disabled, you can replace it with your own parameter(s). For example, to implement Universal Analytics Site Speed Sample Rate, enter the following code in the plugin setting "Custom Tracker Objects":

	{'siteSpeedSampleRate': 100}

Save changes and done. The resulting tracking code will now look like this:

	ga('create', 'GA-123456789000', {'siteSpeedSampleRate': 100});

So can adjust things as needed to add any parameters that are required.


**How to implement Anonymize?**

1. Add to "Custom Tracker Objects" setting: `{ 'anonymize_ip': true }`
2. Save changes and done.
