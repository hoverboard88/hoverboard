## Description ##
Provides a General Settings menu option to define a rel=\"me\" in metatags for the whole site, and also for individual contributors.

This [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) plugin adds menu options to define a rel="me" in metatags. This is useful for validating personal blogs with [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) instances and to verify Authors of group blogs.

This plugin was tested on Wordpress 6.1. Compatiblity with earlier or later versions is unknown.

## Installation & Use ##
1. Install the [Simple Mastodon Verification](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-mastodon-verification) plugin from the Wordpress store and enable in the Plugin menu, or
2. Unzip and upload the files to */wp-content/themes/simple-mastodon verification* and enable in the Plugin menu.

### Admin verification ###
The plugin will add a field at the bottom of the *General Settings* page (Admin Dashboard > Settings>General Settings), labelled "Verify Mastodon URL". The field should accept any valid mastodon user URL up to three sub-domains deep. i.e https://mastodon.social/@user to https://my.mastodon.del.icio.us/@user The plugin does *not* accept Mastodon addresses (@user@domain.tld)

When a valid URL has been saved, a tag containing a rel="me" link pointing to the Mastodon user profile will be added near the top of the site's metadata (between <head> elements). If a link to the Wordpress instance is added as one of that user's profile metadata, the Mastodon instance will validate the ownership of the URL and add a green "verified" banner to the URL.

### Author verification ###
If an Administrator enables the "Verify Authors' profiles" option on the *General Settings* page (Admin Dashboard > Settings>General Settings), a field labelled "Mastodon URL" will be added to users' profile pages (under "contact info").

When a valid URL has been saved, a tag containing a rel="me" link will be added to the metadata (between <head> elements) on the Author's archive page *only*. If a link to the Wordpress Author archive is added as one of that's user's profile metadata, the Mastodon instance will validate the ownership of the URL and add a green "verified" banner to the URL.
